        Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction.
    `, `
        <p>Verse 1:<br>
        In the world of motion, there's a key we must know<br>
        Acceleration's the name, let the knowledge now grow<br>
        It's how velocity changes, as time passes by<br>
        The rate of that shift, that's what we define</p>
        <p>Chorus:<br>
        Acceleration, it's got a formula so clear<br>
        The change in Velocity, over total time<br>
        It tells us how things speed up or slow down from here<br>
        In the physics world, it's a concept so fine</p>
        <p>Verse 2:<br>
        When the acceleration's positive, we start to fly<br>
        Speeding up so fast, reaching for the sky<br>
        Distance covered grows quicker, with each passing tick<br>
        As the speed keeps on rising, it's quite a slick</p>
        <p>Verse 3:<br>
        But when it's negative, we're slowing down our pace<br>
        The speed starts to drop, like in a steady chase<br>
        Distance still changes, but now at a different rate<br>
        As we ease off the throttle, it's our new state</p>
        <p>Verse 4:<br>
        And the gradient on a graph can show us too<br>
        How speed relates to time, it's a view so true<br>
        A steep slope means fast acceleration is there<br>
        While a flat line means it's steady, with no change to share</p>
        <p>Chorus:<br>
        Acceleration, it's got a formula so clear<br>
        The change in Velocity, over total time<br>
        It tells us how things speed up or slow down from here<br>
        In the physics world, it's a concept so fine</p>
        <p>Outro:<br>
        Acceleration, it's part of our physical lore<br>
        Helping us understand motion evermore<br>
        With its formula and tales of speed's ebb and flow<br>
        In our song of physics, its story we'll show</p>

        Falling refers to the motion of an object moving downward under the influence of gravity.

        <p>Verse 1:<br>
        There's a story in the sky, of a wild free fall<br>
        A person takes a leap, defying it all<br>
        At the start, weight's got the upper hand<br>
        Air resistance is weak, as they leave the land</p>
        <p>Acceleration kicks in, they're falling fast<br>
        Force is at play, it's gravity's blast<br>
        Weight minus air res., the formula's clear<br>
        They're speeding down, with a touch of fear</p>
        <p>Chorus:<br>
        In this fall from up high, it's a physics ride<br>
        Weight and air res., in a push and pull tide<br>
        Velocity changes, as the forces collide<br>
        In this daring leap, there's science inside</p>
        <p>Verse 2:<br>
        As they plunge through air, air resistance grows<br>
        Trying to slow them down, as everyone knows<br>
        Till it catches up, and becomes just as strong<br>
        Velocity levels, it's a steady throng</p>
        <p>Equal now they are, no more acceleration<br>
        Floating for a while, in this strange sensation<br>
        The graph would show a flat line for a span<br>
        In this moment of balance, it's part of the plan</p>
        <p>Verse 3:<br>
        Then out comes the parachute, a game-changer here<br>
        Air resistance spikes, makes their speed disappear<br>
        Weight's still the same, but now they're taking it slow<br>
        The fall's transformed, like a gentle snow</p>
        <p>Once again, the forces start to align<br>
        Equalize once more, as they near the ground line<br>
        And with a soft touch, they land in the end<br>
        This fall from the sky, a physics friend.</p>
        <p>Outro:<br>
        From height to ground, with forces all around<br>
        Weight and air res., their story is found<br>
        In this wild adventure, science has shown<br>
        The journey of a fall, we've put in a song.</p>

        Moment is the turning effect of a force about a pivot point. Momentum is the product of an object's mass and its velocity. It is also a vector quantity.
    `, `
        <p>Verse 1:<br>
        Come along and let's discover moment's tale<br>
        Where force and distance together set the scale<br>
        The formula's clear, moment equals force times distance<br>
        In every physical scene, it plays a part precise</p>
        <p>From levers working to turn things around<br>
        To gears in motion, where it's always found<br>
        As we multiply force by how far it acts<br>
        The moment emerges, like a secret pact</p>
        <p>Chorus:<br>
        Oh, moment, a crucial element in our sight<br>
        In equilibrium's balance, shining bright<br>
        When anti-clockwise and clockwise moments meet<br>
        Stability reigns, in a state so sweet</p>
        <p>Verse 2:<br>
        Think of a seesaw, a classic example grand<br>
        Kids having fun, as it moves with a command<br>
        One side goes up, one side goes down so free<br>
        Till moments balance, in harmony we see</p>
        <p>To find that balance, we must make sure<br>
        The sum of anti-clockwise equals clockwise for sure<br>
        With moment (anti-clockwise) = moment (clockwise)<br>
        The seesaw stays still, a peaceful allure</p>
        <p>Verse 3:<br>
        Now let's shift our focus to momentum's flight<br>
        Momentum equals mass times velocity, that's right<br>
        In the world of motion, it's a powerful guide<br>
        When objects collide, it's there by their side</p>
        <p>In an elastic collision, there's a special way<br>
        They bounce back quick, with energy to display<br>
        Kinetic energy stays the same, it's quite a sight<br>
        While momentum's conserved, through day and night</p>
        <p>Verse 4:<br>
        In inelastic collisions, things are a bit changed<br>
        Objects might stick or slow down, rearranged<br>
        Yet still, momentum's conserved, never lost<br>
        As they combine or move along, whatever the cost</p>
        <p>Chorus<br>
        Whether it's balls hitting or cars that crash<br>
        Momentum's rule holds firm, without a dash<br>
        With its formula telling us how it will go<br>
        We understand these motions, from high to low</p>

        Moment and momentum, with their formulas grand<br>
        In equilibrium and collisions, they command<br>
        In this world of science, they're our guiding light<br>
